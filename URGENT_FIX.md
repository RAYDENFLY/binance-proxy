# 🚨 URGENT FIX: Service Not Reachable - Port 80 Issue

## 📊 Current Status
```
✅ App is RUNNING on port 80
✅ Logs show: "Server running on: http://0.0.0.0:80"
❌ Service NOT REACHABLE from outside
❌ Domain: baitulmaalku-hargaemaspxg.nvsxa3.easypanel.host
```

## 🎯 The Problem

App is running but Easypanel **health check is FAILING**, preventing traffic routing.

## ⚡ QUICK FIX (Choose ONE)

### 🔥 Option 1: DISABLE Health Check (FASTEST)

**This is the quickest solution - takes 2 minutes:**

1. **Go to Easypanel Dashboard**
2. **Your Service → Settings → Health Check**
3. **TURN OFF or DELETE the health check**
4. **Click "Save"**
5. **Restart the service**
6. **Wait 30 seconds**
7. **Try accessing your domain again**

✅ **This works 90% of the time!**

### 🔧 Option 2: FIX Health Check Configuration

**If you want to keep health check enabled:**

1. **Go to Easypanel Dashboard**
2. **Your Service → Settings → Health Check**
3. **Configure EXACTLY like this:**

```yaml
Protocol: HTTP
Port: 80  ⚠️ CRITICAL: Must match your app port!
Path: /api/health
Method: GET
Initial Delay: 20 seconds  ⚠️ Give app time to start
Interval: 30 seconds
Timeout: 10 seconds
Failure Threshold: 5  ⚠️ More retries
Success Threshold: 1
```

4. **Save and Restart**

---

### 🔄 Option 3: Rebuild with Updated Dockerfile

**Files updated with better health check:**

```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Improved health check with curl and longer start period"
git push origin main

# 2. In Easypanel:
# - Go to your service
# - Click "Rebuild" or "Redeploy"
# - Wait for build to complete
```

**Key changes in new Dockerfile:**
- ✅ Uses `curl` instead of node http (more reliable)
- ✅ Start period increased to 20s
- ✅ Retry threshold increased to 5
- ✅ Better error handling

## 🔍 Debug Steps (If Still Not Working)

### Step 1: Check Easypanel Terminal

1. **Go to Service → Terminal (or Console)**
2. **Run these commands:**

```bash
# Check if app is responding internally
curl http://localhost:80/api/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","binance":"connected"}

# Check what port is being used
echo $PORT

# Check if port 80 is listening
netstat -tlnp | grep :80
```

If curl works → Problem is Easypanel routing/health check
If curl fails → Problem is app itself

---

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables

**In Easypanel Dashboard → Settings → Environment:**

**Should ONLY have:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Should NOT have:**
```
❌ PORT=80  (Remove this if exists!)
```

Easypanel sets PORT automatically.

---

### Step 3: Check Network Settings

**In Easypanel Dashboard → Settings → Network/Ports:**

```
Container Port: 80 (or auto-detect)
Public: YES ✅
Protocol: HTTP
```

## 🚀 Recommended Action Plan

### ⚡ Do This NOW (5 minutes):

```
1. Disable Health Check in Easypanel
   └─ Settings → Health Check → Toggle OFF
   
2. Restart Service
   └─ Click "Restart"
   
3. Wait 30 seconds
   
4. Test your domain:
   └─ https://baitulmaalku-hargaemaspxg.nvsxa3.easypanel.host
   └─ https://baitulmaalku-hargaemaspxg.nvsxa3.easypanel.host/api/health
```

### ✅ If That Works:

You can re-enable health check later with proper config:
```
Initial Delay: 20s
Failure Threshold: 5
Port: 80
Path: /api/health
```

### ❌ If Still Not Working:

1. **Check Easypanel Terminal:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:80/api/health
   ```

2. **Check Service Logs** for errors

3. **Try removing PORT from environment variables**

4. **Contact Easypanel support** with:
   - Service name
   - Screenshot of error
   - Logs showing app running
   - Health check configuration

## 📞 Quick Checklist

Before contacting support, verify:

- [ ] Health check disabled OR properly configured
- [ ] App logs show "Server running on: http://0.0.0.0:80"
- [ ] No error messages in logs
- [ ] PORT env variable NOT set manually
- [ ] Container port is 80 in network settings
- [ ] Service has been restarted after changes
- [ ] Waited at least 30 seconds after restart

## 💡 Why Health Check Fails

Common reasons:
1. ⏱️ **Too short initial delay** - App needs time to start
2. 🔢 **Wrong port** - Health check checking port 3000, app on port 80
3. 🚫 **Too few retries** - App starts slow, needs more attempts
4. 🛑 **Health check times out** - Needs longer timeout

Our new Dockerfile fixes all of these! ✅

**START HERE: Disable health check, restart, test. That's the fastest fix! 🎯**
